Simple applescript that takes whatever text you have highlighted and replaces the characters with currency symbols when applicable.

For example, the previous sentence would become:

$imp£€ app£€$¢ript that tak€$ what€v€r t€xt ¥ou hav€ high£ight€d and r€p£a¢€$ th€ ¢hara¢t€r$ with ¢urr€n¢¥ $¥mbo£$ wh€n app£i¢ab£€.

The script copies the highlighted text to the clipboard, manipulates the clipboard text, and pastes back the new string.  Rig this up with a keyboard shortcut app (like Apptivate), and you can easily make that money.
